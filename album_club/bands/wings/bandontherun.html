        <p>As vinyl has taken over most of my music I have had more of an appreciation for older albums and just how great they are. The vibes, sound, and overall feel of the songs on vinyl are different. “Band On The Run” will take you back to a time when an album release was the equivalent to a new iPhone coming out today.</p>
        <p>The reason why I submitted this album was that one it's a physical album I have and can listen to on the daily if I so choose too. Also, it has one of my favorite Beatles on it. Perhaps it might encourage everyone in the group to seek out some type of physical music.</p>
        <p>It is considered one of McCartney's finest albums post-Beatles. The album features some of my favorites like the title track "Band on the Run," "Bluebird”, “Let Me Roll It”, “Jet” and “Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five.” It's known for its eclectic mix of rock, pop, and even some reggae influences, showcasing McCartney's songwriting versatility and the band's musical prowess.</q></p>
