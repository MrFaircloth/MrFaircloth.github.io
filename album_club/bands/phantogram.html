<p>Phantogram's fourth studio album, 'Ceremony,' was self-produced and recorded in Los Angeles, California, and Saratoga Springs, New York. The inspiration behind the album stemmed from the tragic loss of Barthel's sister, Becky, who passed away in 2019. Serving as a heartfelt tribute to her memory, the album reflects the band's journey in coping with grief while navigating their newfound professional success, which followed the release of their previous album, 'Three.'</p>

<h3>The Band</h3>
<p>Originating from Greenwich, New York, Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter formed the band Charlie Everywhere in 2007, eventually changing the name in 2009 to Phantogram. The name was suggested by Carter as he felt the illusionary properties of bringing 2D images into the third dimension aligned with the band's identity.</p>
<br/>
<p>Barthel and Carter were friends from a very young age, both growing up on farms in Greenwich. Barthel, inspired by her late father and her own fascination with the craft, found herself gravitating towards photography and the visual arts. Carter drew much of his musical interest through listening to the Beatles growing up and also being introduced to bands like Dinosaur Jr and My Bloody Valentine by his "cool" older brother, John.</p>
<br/>
<p>Barthel went on to study visual arts at Champlain College, VT, while Carter performed in an experimental band, Grand Habit, in New York City with his brother. Thereafter, both returned home in search of a new direction, eventually joining together in making records. Capitalizing on Barthel's background in visual arts and Carter's musical experience, they focus on combining both music and visuals to turn their art into an experience.</p>
<br>
<p>The band has had many notable collaborations with artists such as Miley Cyrus, Tom Morello, and Big Boi. Their song "K.Y.S.A" was also featured on a fictional radio station, The Lab, in Rockstar's video game, Grand Theft Auto V.</p>
